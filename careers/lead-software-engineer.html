              <h1>Lead Software Engineer</h1>
              <p>
                At Circuit Mind we are completely automating the design of electronic circuit
                boards.<br /><br />
                Electronic circuit boards are at the core of current and future inventions - mobile
                phones,
                augmented reality, autonomous vehicles and spacecrafts. Yet today designing an
                electronic
                circuit board is an extremely manual, long and tedious process. At Circuit Mind we
                believe that
                this is wrong and we are on a mission to fix it, triggering the future of hardware
                design.<br /><br />
                Taking inspiration from the integrated circuit workflow (hardware description language,
                logic
                synthesis, automated place and route), we are creating an entirely new software engine
                for
                circuit boards, that takes as inputs the requirements of a circuit board and
                automatically outputs
                a complete design, ready for manufacture.<br /><br />
                Several small and large engineering companies are waiting for Circuit Mind’s technology.
                We got the backing of world-class VC investors and we
                are creating a tight-knit interdisciplinary team of 10 people with outstanding technical
                abilities in
                electronic engineering, software engineering and algorithm design. We are looking for
                humble
                perpetual learners who are driven and able to think critically.
                We are excited to offer you the opportunity to be part of our founding team and play a major role in
                shaping Circuit Mind from the beginning.
              </p>
              <h3>Position: Lead Software Engineer</h3>
              <p>
