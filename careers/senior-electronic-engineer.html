              <h1>Senior Electronic Engineer</h1>
              <p>
                At Circuit Mind we are completely automating the design of electronic circuit
                boards.<br /><br />
                Electronic circuit boards are at the core of current and future inventions - mobile
                phones,
                augmented reality, autonomous vehicles and spacecrafts. Yet today designing an
                electronic
                circuit board is an extremely manual, long and tedious process. At Circuit Mind we
                believe that
                this is wrong and we are on a mission to fix it, triggering the future of hardware
                design.<br /><br />
                Taking inspiration from the integrated circuit workflow (hardware description language,
                logic
                synthesis, automated place and route), we are creating an entirely new software engine
                for
                circuit boards, that takes as inputs the requirements of a circuit board and
                automatically outputs
                a complete design, ready for manufacture. In the short term, the software engine
                augments the
                circuit design work of our electronic engineering team; in the long run, we aim to bring
                automation to nearly 100%.<br /><br />
                Several small and large engineering companies are waiting for Circuit Mind’s technology.
                We got the backing of world-class VC investors and we are creating a tight-knit interdisciplinary team
                of 10 people with outstanding technical
                abilities in
                electronic engineering, software engineering and algorithm design. We are looking for
                humble
                perpetual learners who are driven and able to think critically.
                We are excited to offer you the opportunity to be part of our founding team and play a major role in
                shaping Circuit Mind from the beginning.
              </p>
              <h3>Position: Senior Electronic Engineer</h3>
              <p>
                Your mission is to design printed circuit boards for clients (schematic and layout) and
                inform the
                architecture of Circuit Mind’s core software technology by providing the electronic
                design
                knowledge to the rest of the engineering team.
              </p>
              <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Design circuit boards for customers in a wide range of industries (consumer,
                    automotive,
                    communications and more):</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Gather requirements</li>
                    <li>Capture schematic</li>
                    <li>Layout the board to meet constraints including power integrity, signal
                      integrity, EMI,
                      thermal, DFM and more</li>
                    <li>Perform simulations of functional and non-functional behaviour (power, EMI,
                      thermal and
                      more)</li>
                    <li>Verify and test the board.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Provide the electronic design knowledge to the software and algorithm engineers
                    to create software
                    that automates:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Component selection</li>
                    <li>Schematic capture</li>
                    <li>Layout</li>
                    <li>Functional and non-functional simulations.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Inform the work of the software engineers to design a novel high-level
                    abstraction.
                    The abstraction allows one to specify the functional and non-functional
                    requirements of circuit
                    boards, which are the input to our core software. This novel abstraction for
                    circuit boards is the
                    equivalent of the hardware description languages used for integrated circuits.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                We’d also love you to inform, iterate and challenge the business and technology
                strategy, and to actively contribute to hiring the rest of the Circuit Mind engineering team.
              </p>
